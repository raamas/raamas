### Hello, my name is Omar 

I'm a tech enthusiast who also happens to code.
i love mexican music even though i'm colombian, and i also love javascript. 
my main goal here is to share what i learn throughout the years and maybe even land a job. 
i'm not gonna list any technologies here but rather just let them shine in the pinned seccion and the README file of every project. if you want to contact me text my twitter account or my linkedin. happy hacking.
